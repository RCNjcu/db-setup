# AUTOMATED DATABASE IMPORTATION SCRIPT
    This is a set of scripts made for usage on MacOS and certain Linux Distros.

# Make sure your local has the following:
    -DOCKER
    -The database file in the local sites directory
    -Check if you have "usr/local/bin"(If you don't the script installer can help create it)

# Instructions
    For Installing globally
        -With terminal open in the directory, run installer script using /bash installer.
        -You should be able to use "dbsetup" command to run the automated import

    To manually run the script you can simply do "/bash dbsetup"
    (NOTICE: IF you manually run the script it is best to place the script in the same directory as your local)
